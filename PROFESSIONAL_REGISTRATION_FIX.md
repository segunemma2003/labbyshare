# Professional Registration Fix

## üêõ **Issue Identified**

During professional registration, the following data was **NOT being saved**:

- ‚ùå **Regions** (professional-region relationships)
- ‚ùå **Services** (professional-service relationships)
- ‚ùå **Availability** (weekly schedule)

## üîç **Root Cause**

The issue was in the `ProfessionalRegistrationSerializer.create()` method in `professionals/serializers.py`:

1. **Missing Import**: The `Region` model was not imported in the availability creation section
2. **Silent Failures**: Availability creation errors were being silently ignored
3. **No Error Logging**: Failed availability creation wasn't being logged for debugging

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Fixed Missing Import**

```python
# Before (line ~250 in serializers.py)
region = Region.objects.get(id=region_id)  # Region not imported!

# After
from regions.models import Region  # Added import
region = Region.objects.get(id=region_id)
```

### **2. Added Error Logging**

```python
# Before
except (Region.DoesNotExist, KeyError, ValueError):
    continue  # Silent failure

# After
except (Region.DoesNotExist, KeyError, ValueError) as e:
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.error(f"Error creating availability for professional {professional.id}: {e}")
    continue
```

## üìã **What Gets Saved Now**

### **‚úÖ Regions**

- Professional-region relationships via `ProfessionalRegion` model
- Sets `is_primary` and `travel_fee` for each region

### **‚úÖ Services**

- Professional-service relationships via `ProfessionalService` model
- Creates entries for each region-service combination
- Sets custom pricing and service settings

### **‚úÖ Availability**

- Weekly schedule via `ProfessionalAvailability` model
- Creates availability slots for each region
- Includes break times and active status

## üß™ **Testing**

Created `test_professional_registration.py` to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_professional_registration.py
```

This test:

1. Creates a test professional with regions, services, and availability
2. Verifies all data is saved correctly
3. Shows detailed output of what was created
4. Cleans up test data

## üìä **Expected Registration Data**

### **Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "bio": "Professional bio",
  "experience_years": 5,
  "travel_radius_km": 15,
  "min_booking_notice_hours": 24,
  "cancellation_policy": "24 hours notice required",
  "regions": [1, 2],
  "services": [1, 2, 3],
  "availability": [
    {
      "region_id": 1,
      "weekday": 0,
      "start_time": "09:00:00",
      "end_time": "17:00:00",
      "break_start": "12:00:00",
      "break_end": "13:00:00",
      "is_active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### **What Gets Created:**

1. **Professional Profile** (basic info)
2. **2 ProfessionalRegion entries** (one for each region)
3. **6 ProfessionalService entries** (2 regions √ó 3 services)
4. **1 ProfessionalAvailability entry** (weekly schedule)

## üîß **Additional Improvements**

### **1. Better Error Handling**

- Added logging for availability creation failures
- More descriptive error messages

### **2. Validation**

- Availability data is validated before creation
- Required fields are checked
- Time ranges are validated

### **3. Database Integrity**

- Proper foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints enforced
- Transaction safety

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Registration Endpoint:**

```
POST /api/v1/professionals/register/
```

### **Required Fields:**

- `bio`, `experience_years`, `travel_radius_km`
- `regions` (list of region IDs)
- `services` (list of service IDs)
- `availability` (optional list of availability objects)

### **Response:**

```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "user": {...},
    "bio": "Professional bio",
    "regions_served": [...],
    "services": [...],
    "availability": [...],
    "is_verified": false,
    "profile_completed": true
}
```

## üìù **Notes**

- **Regions and Services are required** during registration
- **Availability is optional** but recommended
- **Professional starts as unverified** until admin approval
- **Profile completion** is tracked for onboarding flow

The fix ensures that all professional registration data is properly saved and the booking system can find available professionals with their correct services and schedules.
